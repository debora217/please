<h2> Love enemy </h2>

<p> 32 â€œIf you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.</p>
<p>33 And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that. </p>
<p>34 And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. </p>
<p>35 But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.</p> 
<p>36 Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.</p>
